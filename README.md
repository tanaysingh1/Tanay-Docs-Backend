Index.js contains 5 API's; POST:Add file, Edit File, GET: Get file, Get filenames DELETE: Delete file
Create a new folder named "files" upon running this- that is where the txt files are saved. If you want a different name, make sure to change line 9 in index.js(const folderPath = path.join(__dirname, "files");) to reflect the folder name.
Server runs on port 8080 by default
Run node . to start the server. If you see the "server is running" message in the console, you're good to go.
Have fun :)
